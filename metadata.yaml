summary: '"Mendizábal" by Benito Pérez Galdós is a historical novel written in the
  late 19th century. This work is part of Galdós''s "Episodios Nacionales," a series
  that chronicles Spain''s historical events through the eyes of vivid characters.
  The narrative unfolds amidst the backdrop of Spain''s tumultuous political landscape
  in the 19th century, primarily focusing on the character of Fernando Calpena, a
  young man arriving in Madrid eager for adventure and opportunity.  The opening of
  the novel introduces Fernando Calpena, who arrives in Madrid and is immediately
  engulfed in a bustling scene at a local inn. While awaiting a mysterious acquaintance,
  he reflects on the excitement and peril associated with his new city. He is approached
  by an unsavory-looking character who reveals that he has been sent to escort him
  to a guesthouse, raising Fernando''s suspicions about his circumstances. Once at
  the guesthouse, he learns he has been welcomed in a manner fuelled by connections
  to the influential Mendizábal, a minister central to the political reform efforts
  in Spain. As Fernando navigates through this unfamiliar world of political intrigue
  and societal ambition, he begins to forge relationships with his fellow tenants,
  including a dialogue rich with political commentary that sets the stage for his
  adventures to unfold. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
